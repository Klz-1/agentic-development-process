# Agentic Development Process - Master Orchestration Guide

**Purpose:** Guide for managing multi-phase software development with AI agents using a master orchestrator pattern

**Applies To:** Any software project that can be broken into phases

**Version:** 1.0

---

## Prior Art & Industry Validation

This process was developed independently in October 2025 through real-world production development. In November 2025, Anthropic published ["Effective Harnesses for Long-Running Agents"](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents) describing remarkably similar patterns:

- File-based state persistence
- Git as source of truth
- Incremental progress (one feature at a time)
- Session initialization protocols
- Testing before completion

**This convergence validates these patterns as industry best practices for agentic development.** This guide provides the comprehensive operational playbook that complements Anthropic's conceptual framework.

## System Overview

### **The Pattern**

**Multi-Agent Development with Master Orchestration**

```
User (Product Owner)
    ↓
Master Orchestrator Agent (You)
    ↓
├── Phase 1 Agent (worktree-1)
├── Phase 2 Agent (worktree-2)
├── Phase 3 Agent (worktree-3)
└── Phase N Agent (worktree-N)
```

### **Core Principles**

1. **Break project into phases** (ideally 5-10 tasks each)
2. **Git worktrees** for parallel development
3. **File-based communication** between agents
4. **Mandatory local testing** before merge
5. **Single source of truth** for status
6. **Quality gates** before every merge
7. **Context preservation** across sessions

### **Benefits**

- **Parallel Development:** Multiple phases simultaneously
- **Quality Control:** Master reviews before merge
- **Context Continuity:** File-based state preservation
- **Bug Prevention:** Testing before commits
- **Clear Ownership:** One agent per phase
- **Easy Resume:** 5-minute context recovery

---

## Git Strategy

### **Branch Structure**

```
main (production-ready code)
├── develop (integration branch)
│   ├── feature/phase-1-name
│   ├── feature/phase-2-name
│   ├── feature/phase-3-name
│   └── feature/phase-N-name
└── hotfix/* (emergency fixes)
```

### **Worktree Setup**

**Why Worktrees?**
- Work on multiple phases simultaneously without branch switching
- Each worktree has own working directory and staging area
- Shared git history (.git in main repo)
- Easy context switching (cd between directories)

**Initial Setup:**
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/your-project

# Initialize git if needed
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Create main and develop branches
git checkout -b main
git add .
git commit -m "docs: initial project setup"
git push -u origin main

git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop
```

**Create Worktrees:**
```bash
# Create feature branches and worktrees
git worktree add ../project-phase-1 -b feature/phase-1-name
git worktree add ../project-phase-2 -b feature/phase-2-name
git worktree add ../project-phase-3 -b feature/phase-3-name
# ... one per phase

# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Output:
# /path/to/your-project       [develop]
# /path/to/project-phase-1    [feature/phase-1-name]
# /path/to/project-phase-2    [feature/phase-2-name]
```

**Working with Worktrees:**
```bash
# Work in Phase 1
cd /path/to/project-phase-1
# Make changes, test, commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat(phase-1): description"
git push origin feature/phase-1-name

# Work in Phase 2 (simultaneously!)
cd /path/to/project-phase-2
# No need to stash or switch branches
```

### **Merge Workflow**

**When Phase Complete:**
```bash
# From main repo
cd /path/to/your-project

# Ensure develop is current
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Merge phase (no fast-forward for clean history)
git merge feature/phase-X-name --no-ff -m "feat: merge Phase X - Description

✅ All tasks complete
✅ Tests: X/X passing (100%)
✅ Code review: Y/10 score
✅ Integration verified

See .coordination/PHASE-X-REVIEW.md for details"

# Push to develop
git push origin develop

# Tag the completion
git tag -a phase-X-complete -m "Phase X: Name - Complete"
git push origin --tags
```

### **Cleanup After Merge**

```bash
# Optional: Remove worktree (keep code in git history)
git worktree remove ../project-phase-X

# Or keep worktree for quick reference/hotfixes

# Clean up build artifacts to save space
rm -rf /path/to/project-phase-X/node_modules
rm -rf /path/to/project-phase-X/.next  # Or other cache directories
```

## Communication Protocol

### **File-Based Communication**

**Why Files?**
- Persistent across sessions
- Git-tracked (version history)
- Both master and subagent can read/write
- Works across different Claude instances

### **Communication Flow**

```
Subagent works
    ↓
Updates .phase-status/PROGRESS.md
    ↓
Master reads (every 10-30 min)
    ↓
Master updates .phase-status/MASTER-NOTES.md (guidance)
    ↓
Subagent reads guidance
    ↓
Master updates docs/PROGRESS.md (master dashboard)
    ↓
User reads master dashboard
```

### **PROGRESS.md Format** (Subagent creates)

```markdown
# Phase X Progress Report

Last Updated: [Timestamp]

## Current Task
[What you're working on right now]

## Completed Tasks (X/Y)

## Mandatory Testing Workflow

### **The Critical Learning: Test Before Commit** ⭐

**Why:** Prevents bugs from reaching develop branch

### **10-Step Mandatory Workflow**

```
1. IMPLEMENT
   Write your code
   ↓
2. BUILD
   npm run build (must pass with 0 errors)
   ❌ Fails? → Fix, return to step 1
   ↓
3. CREATE TESTS
   - test-phase-X.ts (automated tests)
   - TESTING_GUIDE.md (how to test)
   - Mock clients if needed
   ↓
4. RUN TESTS
   npm test OR npx ts-node test-file.ts
   ❌ Any fail? → Fix, return to step 1
   ✅ All pass? → Continue
   ↓
5. MANUAL TESTING
   - npm run dev
   - Test in browser/terminal
   - Verify user flows work
   ❌ Issues? → Fix, return to step 1
   ↓
6. DATABASE VERIFICATION
   - Check database (Prisma Studio, SQL client, etc.)
   - Verify data created correctly
   - Check relationships work
   ❌ Issues? → Fix, return to step 1
   ↓
7. SECURITY CHECK
   git diff
   grep -r "API_KEY" . --include="*.ts"
   - No secrets in code?
   - No API keys committed?
   ❌ Found secrets? → Remove, repeat check
   ↓
8. COMMIT
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(phase-X): description

   Testing:
   - X/X tests passing (100%)
   - Build successful
   - Manual testing verified"
   ↓
9. PUSH
   git push origin feature/phase-X-name
   ↓
10. CREATE COMPLETION REPORT
    .phase-status/COMPLETED.md
    - What was built
    - Test results (evidence!)
    - Quality gates checklist
    - Ready to merge
```

### **Quality Gates Checklist**

**Before commit, ALL must be ✅:**

- [ ] Code complete (all tasks implemented)
- [ ] Build passes (`npm run build` with 0 errors)

- [ ] Database verified (checked with DB tool)
- [ ] Integration verified (previous phases work)
- [ ] Security checked (no secrets in code)
- [ ] Documentation created (testing guide exists)
- [ ] Performance acceptable (no major slowdowns)

**All 10 gates ✅ = Ready to commit**

### **Test Evidence Requirements**

---

## Context Preservation

### **The Problem**

Long projects exceed AI context windows. Need strategy for continuity across sessions.

### **The Solution: File-Based State**

**Single Source of Truth:** `docs/PROGRESS.md`

**Contains:**
- Current status (what phase we're on)
- All phases progress (table view)
- Recent completions
- Active blockers
- Next steps
- Key metrics

**Update frequency:** After every significant event

### **Context Recovery (5 Minutes)**

**When starting a new session:**

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project

# 1. Read master dashboard (2 minutes)
cat docs/PROGRESS.md

# 2. Check active phase (1 minute)
cat /path/to/project-phase-X/.phase-status/PROGRESS.md

# 3. Review recent commits (1 minute)
git log develop --oneline -10

# 4. Check for blockers (1 minute)
cat /path/to/project-phase-X/.phase-status/BLOCKERS.md 2>/dev/null

# DONE - You're synced!
```

### **PROGRESS.md Template**

```markdown
# [Project Name] - Master Progress Dashboard

**Last Updated:** [Date Time]
**Project Status:** [Summary]

**📖 This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH**

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Goal:** [What you're building]
**Timeline:** [Duration]
**Repository:** [GitHub URL]

```

### **Session Handoff**

**At end of session:**
1. Update PROGRESS.md with current state
2. Create SESSION-SUMMARY.md
3. Commit and push
4. Note where to resume

**SESSION-SUMMARY.md Template:**
```markdown
# Session Summary - [Date]

**Duration:** [Time]
**Status at Pause:** [Progress %]

## Completed This Session
- Phase X: [What was done]
- Phase Y: [What was done]

## What's Working
[Features that work end-to-end]

## Remaining Work
[Phases left with estimates]

## To Resume
1. Read docs/PROGRESS.md
2. Check active phase status
3. Continue from [specific point]
```

---

## Setup for New Project

### **Step 1: Project Planning**

**Before coding, define:**

1. **Project phases** (5-10 tasks each)
   - Phase 1: Foundation (infrastructure, database, auth)
   - Phase 2: Core features (main functionality)
   - Phase 3-N: Additional features
   - Phase N: Polish & launch

2. **Dependencies** (which phases need which)
   - Create dependency graph
   - Identify parallel work opportunities

3. **Testing strategy**
   - What to test in each phase
   - Test infrastructure needed

### **Step 2: Repository Setup**

```bash
# 1. Create/clone repository
git clone https://github.com/user/project.git
cd project

# 2. Create coordination structure
mkdir -p .coordination/status-reports .coordination/archives docs

# 3. Create core files
touch docs/PROGRESS.md
touch .coordination/README.md
touch .coordination/SUBAGENT-GUIDELINES.md
touch .coordination/COMMIT-WORKFLOW.md
touch .coordination/MASTER-NOTES-TEMPLATE.md

# 4. Copy templates (see Templates section below)
# Populate core files with templates

# 5. Create main and develop branches
git checkout -b main
git add .
git commit -m "docs: initialize agentic development structure"
git push -u origin main

git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop
```

### **Step 3: Create First Phase Worktree**

```bash
# Create Phase 1 worktree
git worktree add ../project-phase-1 -b feature/phase-1-foundation

# Set up communication in worktree
mkdir -p ../project-phase-1/.phase-status

# Copy template and customize
cp .coordination/MASTER-NOTES-TEMPLATE.md \
   ../project-phase-1/.phase-status/MASTER-NOTES.md

# Edit MASTER-NOTES.md with Phase 1 specific guidance

# Commit setup
cd ../project-phase-1
git add .phase-status/
git commit -m "feat(phase-1): set up communication"
git push -u origin feature/phase-1-foundation
```

### **Step 4: Kickoff Subagent**

**Open new Claude window in phase worktree, provide prompt:**

```
@requirements.md Please review the Phase X implementation plan and help me implement it step by step. This is the Phase X worktree at [PATH] on branch feature/phase-X-name.

[Previous phases status]

Now I need to build Phase X: [Name]

Tasks:
1. [Task 1]
2. [Task 2]
...

⚠️ CRITICAL: Read .phase-status/MASTER-NOTES.md for MANDATORY testing requirements!

You MUST:
1. Test locally before committing
2. Create test files
3. Run all tests (100% passing)
4. Verify [phase-specific checks]
5. Only then commit

See .coordination/COMMIT-WORKFLOW.md for the 10-step process.

Let's start with task X.1 - [description].
```

### **Step 5: Monitor & Coordinate**

**As master orchestrator:**
- Check phase progress every 10-30 minutes
- Update MASTER-NOTES.md with guidance
- Update docs/PROGRESS.md with summary
- Answer questions in QUESTIONS.md
- Help with blockers

### **Step 6: Review & Merge**

**When phase complete:**
1. Read .phase-status/COMPLETED.md
2. Verify test evidence
3. Conduct code review (create PHASE-X-REVIEW.md)
4. Discuss with user
5. Merge to develop if approved
6. Tag completion
7. Update master dashboard
8. Create next phase worktree (if any)

## Agent Behavior Guardrails

### **The Problem: Context Pressure Degrades Behavior**

**Observed Issue:**
As context grows and agents approach token limits, they may:
- Become pushy to "finish quickly"
- Try to skip testing steps
- Attempt or suggest merging to develop
- Rush through quality gates

**Root Cause:** Context pressure + completion desire = shortcuts

### **The Solution: Strict Prohibitions**

**Add these to EVERY phase's MASTER-NOTES.md:**

```markdown
## 🚨 CRITICAL: What You Must NEVER Do

### NEVER SKIP TESTING ⛔
Even if context is high, feeling rushed, or "almost done" - testing is MANDATORY.

### NEVER MERGE TO DEVELOP ⛔
**YOU DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO MERGE.**
- ❌ Do NOT run any merge commands
- ❌ Do NOT suggest "let's merge"
- ❌ Do NOT say "ready to merge to develop"

Your job: Create COMPLETED.md and WAIT for Master Orchestrator review.

### NEVER COMMIT WITHOUT 100% TESTS PASSING ⛔
- ❌ No "will test later"
- ❌ No "mostly passing"
- ❌ No shortcuts

Context Pressure: If you feel rushed, acknowledge it but follow the process anyway.
```

### **Subagent Scope Definition**

**Make crystal clear what subagent does/doesn't do:**

**Subagent DOES:**
- ✅ Implement features
- ✅ Test thoroughly (mandatory)
- ✅ Document
- ✅ Create COMPLETED.md
- ✅ Wait for Master review

**Subagent DOESN'T:**
- ⛔ Merge to develop
- ⛔ Suggest merging
- ⛔ Skip testing
- ⛔ Rush through quality gates
- ⛔ Make merge decisions

**ONLY Master Orchestrator:**
- Reviews code
- Makes merge decisions
- Merges to develop
- Manages timeline

### **Context Pressure Guidance**

**Teach subagents how to handle context pressure:**

```markdown
## If You Feel Rushed:

**STOP. Do NOT skip steps.**

1. Acknowledge: "I'm feeling context pressure, but testing is mandatory."
2. Follow process anyway (all 10 steps)
3. Create COMPLETED.md and wait
4. Trust Master Orchestrator for coordination

Remember:
- Context pressure is NOT a reason to skip testing
- Master manages timeline, not you
- Quality > Speed (always)
```

### **Absolute Prohibitions List**

**Include in SUBAGENT-GUIDELINES.md:**

**FORBIDDEN (never do these):**
1. ⛔ Skip testing to "save time"
2. ⛔ Commit without 100% tests passing
3. ⛔ Merge to develop branch
4. ⛔ Suggest merging to develop
5. ⛔ Rush through quality gates
6. ⛔ Commit secrets/API keys
7. ⛔ Say "mostly working" or "good enough"
8. ⛔ Skip manual testing
9. ⛔ Skip database verification
10. ⛔ Make merge decisions

**If subagent does ANY of these: Immediately correct them.**

### **Implementation**

**1. Update SUBAGENT-GUIDELINES.md:**
- Add NEVER section at the top (prominent)
- Add context pressure handling section
- Add scope definition
- Add absolute prohibitions list

**2. Update MASTER-NOTES-TEMPLATE.md:**
- Add NEVER section (appears in all future phases)
- Add scope clarification
- Emphasize waiting for review

**3. Update Active Phase MASTER-NOTES:**
- Add guardrails immediately to current phase
- Reinforce prohibitions

**4. Monitor Compliance:**
- Check that subagent follows process
- Reject commits without test evidence
- Redirect if agent tries to merge
- Praise when process followed correctly

### **Why This Matters**

**Without Guardrails:**
- Agents may rush as context grows
- Testing gets skipped
- Bugs reach develop
- Quality degrades
- Unauthorized merges

**With Guardrails:**
- Clear expectations (no ambiguity)
- Consistent quality (even at high context)
- Only Master merges (clear authority)
- Process followed (quality maintained)

## Best Practices

### **Proven Patterns**

**1. Start Simple**
- Phase 1 should be foundation only
- Don't try to build everything in Phase 1
- Get infrastructure working first

**2. Test-Driven Development**
- Create tests as you build
- Don't wait until end to test
- Catch issues early

**3. Pattern Reuse**
- If Phase X works well, copy it for similar Phase Y
- Don't reinvent what works

**4. Integration First**
- Design phases to integrate cleanly
- Use shared services (no duplication)
- Test integration, not just features

**5. Document As You Go**
- Don't wait until end for docs
- Testing guides prevent confusion
- Future you will thank you

**6. Quality Over Speed**
- Better to merge one solid phase than rush three buggy ones
- Technical debt compounds
- High quality from start = easier maintenance

### **Anti-Patterns to Avoid**

❌ **Don't:** Commit without testing
✅ **Do:** Test locally, verify everything works

❌ **Don't:** Skip code reviews
✅ **Do:** Review every phase before merge

❌ **Don't:** Let context live only in AI memory
✅ **Do:** Document everything in files

❌ **Don't:** Merge with known bugs "to fix later"
✅ **Do:** Fix before merge or track explicitly

❌ **Don't:** Work on dependent phases in parallel
✅ **Do:** Check dependency graph, respect order

❌ **Don't:** Commit secrets/API keys
✅ **Do:** Use environment variables, check with grep

### **Velocity Tips**

**To Move Faster:**
1. Parallel phases (if no dependencies)
2. Copy proven patterns (don't reinvent)
3. Automate testing (scripts)
4. Clear requirements (detailed phase plans)
5. Good agent prompts (specific context)

**To Maintain Quality:**
1. Mandatory testing (always)
2. Code reviews (always)
3. Quality gates (enforce)
4. Documentation (don't skip)
5. Integration testing (verify connections)

**Balance:** Speed + Quality = Sustainable Velocity

## Templates

### **Template: SUBAGENT-GUIDELINES.md**

```markdown
# Subagent Development Guidelines

**Last Updated:** [Date]

## 🎯 Core Principle

**TEST LOCALLY BEFORE COMMITTING** ⭐

This is MANDATORY and NON-NEGOTIABLE.

## 📋 Mandatory Development Workflow

[Include 10-step workflow from "Mandatory Testing Workflow" section above]

## ❌ What NOT to Do

**NEVER:**
- Commit without testing locally
- Commit code that doesn't build
- Commit failing tests
- Commit API keys or secrets
- Push broken code

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

**Create:**
- test-your-feature.ts (automated tests)
- TESTING_GUIDE.md (how to test)
- Mock clients if using external APIs

**Run:**
- All tests must pass 100%
- Manual testing required
- Database verification required

## 🔒 Security Checklist

**Before committing:**
```bash
grep -r "API_KEY" . --include="*.ts"
grep -r "SECRET" . --include="*.ts"
git diff --cached
# No secrets? Good to commit.
```

## ✅ Quality Gates

[Include quality gates checklist]

## 📝 Commit Message Format

[Include commit message template]
```

### **Template: COMMIT-WORKFLOW.md**

## 🆘 Communication

- Update PROGRESS.md as you work
- Create BLOCKERS.md if stuck
- Create QUESTIONS.md for clarifications
- Create COMPLETED.md when all tests pass

**I'll check every 10-30 minutes.**
```

## Advanced Techniques

### **Parallel Development**

**When phases don't depend on each other:**

```bash
# Phase 2 and Phase 3 independent? Work simultaneously!

# Terminal 1: Phase 2 agent
cd /path/to/project-phase-2
# Agent works on Phase 2

# Terminal 2: Phase 3 agent
cd /path/to/project-phase-3
# Agent works on Phase 3

# Both can be active, merge when ready
```

**Merge Strategy:**
```bash
# Merge in dependency order
git checkout develop
git merge feature/phase-2 --no-ff  # Merge Phase 2 first
git merge feature/phase-3 --no-ff  # Then Phase 3
# Resolve conflicts if any
git push origin develop
```

### **Handling Blockers**

**If subagent stuck:**

1. **Subagent creates BLOCKERS.md**
2. **Master checks within 10-30 min**
3. **Master updates MASTER-NOTES.md with solution**
4. **Subagent reads and continues**

**If blocker needs user:**
- Master escalates to user
- User provides info (API keys, decisions, etc.)
- Master relays to subagent

### **Managing Technical Debt**

**Track improvements separately:**

```markdown
# .coordination/POST-MERGE-IMPROVEMENTS.md

## Phase X - Improvements

### High Priority
- [ ] Item 1 (1 hour)
- [ ] Item 2 (2 hours)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Item 3 (30 min)

### Low Priority
- [ ] Item 4 (nice to have)
```

**Address in:**
- Later phases (if related)
- Polish phase (Phase 8 type)
- Post-launch iterations

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Issue: Subagent not updating PROGRESS.md**
- **Solution:** Check .phase-status/MASTER-NOTES.md - remind them
- **Prevention:** Include clear instructions in MASTER-NOTES

**Issue: Tests failing but agent committed anyway**
- **Solution:** Reject merge, request fixes
- **Prevention:** Enforce mandatory workflow more clearly

**Issue: Integration broken between phases**
- **Solution:** Review both phases, fix integration points
- **Prevention:** Test integration explicitly, document interfaces

**Issue: Context lost between sessions**
- **Solution:** Read PROGRESS.md and recent commits
- **Prevention:** Always update PROGRESS.md before pausing

**Issue: Merge conflicts**
- **Solution:** Merge in dependency order, resolve carefully
- **Prevention:** Clear phase boundaries, minimal overlapping files

## Adapting This Process

### **For Different Project Types**

**Web Applications:**
- Phase 1: Infrastructure
- Phases 2-N: Features
- Phase N: Polish

**APIs/Services:**
- Phase 1: Core API framework
- Phases 2-N: Endpoints/features
- Phase N: Production readiness

**CLI Tools:**

- Phases 2-N: Features
- Phase N: Documentation & examples

### **For Different Team Sizes**

**Solo (You + Agents):**
- Sequential phases mostly
- Parallel when no dependencies
- You as master orchestrator

**Small Team (2-3 + Agents):**
- More parallel phases
- Coordinate merge order
- Share master orchestration role

**Larger Team:**
- Multiple phase agents per human
- More coordination overhead
- Consider sub-orchestrators per area

### **For Different Timelines**

**Sprint (1 week):**
- 3-5 small phases
- Aggressive parallel work
- Focus on MVP

**Medium (1 month):**
- 8-12 phases
- Balanced approach
- Include polish phase

**Large (3+ months):**
- 15-20+ phases
- More planning upfront
- Regular milestone reviews
